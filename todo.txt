plugin for center/fitView via contextMenu for boxes and links that zooms to fit selected object in screen

watch/unwatch box or links via contextMenu/boxHeader/sidebar (prevents unrendering)

bottom toolbar

'Toolbars Everywhere' plugin that makes toolbars addable to boxes

add option to contextMenu of boxes: tag[
  'hidden|unimportant'(e.g. files that start with '.'),
  'common'(used everywhere => incoming links are hidden, linkStart and linkEnd visible),
  'important|expanding'? (sizes up to all available space)
]

show start and end of hidden links to see the direction in which they are going

plugin that that hides or downsizes unimportant files and folders

make it possible to partially set mapData, when links are added position and size should not be set
option to unmpat boxes over contextMenu->unmap/unplace (sets position and size of mapData to undefined)

improve EmptySpaceFinder, should find smaller spaces

introduce SnapMode: {none, snapToGrid, snapToObject}

fix WARNING: error in render thread occured:
Failed to execute 'appendChild' on 'Node': parameter 1 is not of type 'Node'..
the javascript that was tried to execute was: (() => {document.getElementById("unplacedElements").appendChild(document.getElementById("scaleTool"))}).call()

fuse SourcelessBoxes with other Boxes, drag SourcelessBox to other box or drop other box inside SourcelessBox to fuse

improve Grid, implement layer2 and layer3 that is visible when clientRectSize is bigger

snapToGrid also for fromEnd when startDragWithClickToDropMode

improve snapToGrid: when draggable snaps below/behind a box, the box should be marked as dropTarget
improve snapToGrid: when zooming in make snapToGrid finer?

introduce FileManager|MapDataFileManager|FileSystemAdapter|FileSystemManager that queues file operations like RenderManager?

filter to only show some parts, for example only links of one class with variable follow depth

when link is created over contextMenu and click in contextMenu is outside of link.from's box, then dropTarget is wrong as long as link is dragged over a boxBorder

done, but check if working correctly: fix borderingLinks, links are not always updated correctly when dragged

introduce interface Linkable, Box and NodeWidget implement it and have a list of borderingLinks

when a linkHead is dragged over another linkHead and a box the dropTarget is the linkHeads baseBox but it should be the box (somehow set pointer-events: none; for all linkHeads while dragging)

cancel drag when escape is pressed

when saving mapData don't override whole file, only update edited fields, this increases backward compatibility

format mapData.jsons, makes it more human readable

settings to adapt zoom out

improve box header, should not overlap content

double click on FileBoxHeader should open file in editor/ide that is specified in settings

use fs.watchFile(filename[, options], listener) to be notified when files are changed
  - usable for source files because they are changed from arbitrary editor
  - also usable for map files because they can be changed through git
  - notice: fs.unwatchFile(filename[, listener])

improve DragManager to only have one eventListener for each eventType and simply add css-class when draggable is added?

when zoomed far towards a file (or double-click on header) render a editor-window (atom, intellij, eclipse (settable in settings)) as box-body

make html source files markable as executable to display stuff like images, notes
