when a linkHead is dragged over another linkHead and a box the dropTarget is the linkHeads baseBox but it should be the box (somehow set pointer-events: none; for all linkHeads while dragging)

add padding to BoxBorder lines, to make them easier to grab

when saving mapData don't override whole file, only update edited fields, this increases backward compatibility

format mapData.jsons, makes it more human readable

load style from css file, use html/css classes

settings to adapt zoom out

improve box header, should not overlap content

double click on FileBoxHeader should open file in editor/ide that is specified in settings

  - also usable for map files because they can be changed through git
  - notice: fs.unwatchFile(filename[, listener])

improve DragManager to only have one eventListener for each eventType and simply add css-class when draggable is added?
