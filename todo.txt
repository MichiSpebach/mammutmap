return MapData in Box::loadMapData

add padding to BoxBorder lines, to make them easier to grab

delete mapDataFile when box is moved out of directory and update path and refactor path before

when saving mapData don't override whole file, only update edited fields, this increases backward compatibility

load style from css file, use html/css classes

settings to adapt zoom out

improve box header, should not overlap content

check when directory is loaded that sourceFiles and mapFiles match

use fs.watchFile(filename[, options], listener) to be notified when files are changed
  - usable for source files because they are changed from arbitrary editor
  - also usable for map files because they can be changed through git
  - notice: fs.unwatchFile(filename[, listener])

improve DragManager to only have one eventListener for each eventType and simply add css-class when draggable is added?
