when link starts in FileBox: overflow is not visible but should (only hide overflow of inner body)

filter to only show some parts, for example only links of one class with variable follow depth

when link is created over contextMenu and click in contextMenu is outside of link.from's box, then dropTarget is wrong as long as link is dragged over a boxBorder

done, but check if working correctly: fix borderingLinks, links are not always updated correctly when dragged

introduce interface Linkable, Box and LinkEnd implement it and have a list of borderingLinks

when a linkHead is dragged over another linkHead and a box the dropTarget is the linkHeads baseBox but it should be the box (somehow set pointer-events: none; for all linkHeads while dragging)

cancel drag when escape is pressed

add padding to BoxBorder lines, to make them easier to grab

when saving mapData don't override whole file, only update edited fields, this increases backward compatibility

format mapData.jsons, makes it more human readable

load style from css file, use html/css classes

settings to adapt zoom out

improve box header, should not overlap content

double click on FileBoxHeader should open file in editor/ide that is specified in settings

check when directory is loaded that sourceFiles and mapFiles match

use fs.watchFile(filename[, options], listener) to be notified when files are changed
  - usable for source files because they are changed from arbitrary editor
  - also usable for map files because they can be changed through git
  - notice: fs.unwatchFile(filename[, listener])

improve DragManager to only have one eventListener for each eventType and simply add css-class when draggable is added?

when zoomed far towards a file (or double-click on header) render a editor-window (atom, intellij, eclipse (settable in settings)) as box-body

make html source files markable as executable to display stuff like images, notes
