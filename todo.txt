load style from css file, use html/css classes

improve box header, should not overlap content

delete mapDataFile when box is moved out of directory

check when directory is loaded that sourceFiles and mapFiles match

use pointer-events: none; and display boxes while they are dragged

use fs.watchFile(filename[, options], listener) to be notified when files are changed
  - usable for source files because they are changed from arbitrary editor
  - also usable for map files because they can be changed through git
  - notice: fs.unwatchFile(filename[, listener])

improve DragManager to only have one eventListener for each eventType and simply add css-class when draggable is added?
